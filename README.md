# Mars Rover Picture Search

###### Please note this is a work in progress website and documentation, so content and appearance will change during time.

## 1. Introduction ðŸ‘‹

My name is Steve and I'm a Junior Full Stack Web Developer from Berlin, Germany. I graduated from coding bootcamp [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/) in May 2019 and this is my first project I'm working "on my own".

I had a lot of fun using [React](https://reactjs.org/) during my studies, so I decided to dive deeper into the documentation to find out what this JavaScript library is really capable of.

This project will also be my playground for making a website as responsive as possible, as this is not only a really interesting process, but also crucial for making it look good on as many devices as possible. Therefore I will either use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/), I haven't decided yet. ðŸ˜¬

## 2. Idea ðŸ’¡

My main goal will be to create a website that is getting live data from an API of my choice, looks and feels nice and is displayed correctly on mobile devices. For this project I will access the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos) to create a search for photos taken by a Mars rover. It get's even better: You can either filter the search by using the earth date or the martian sol! ðŸ˜±

Depending on the Mars rover selected, you can see photos taken by one of the following cameras:

1. Front Hazard Avoidance Camera
2. Rear Hazard Avoidance Camera
3. Mast Camera
4. Chemistry and Camera Complex
5. Mars Hand Lens Imager
6. Mars Descent Imager
7. Navigation Camera
8. Panoramic Camera
9. Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES)

## 3. Structure ðŸ—‚

```
App.js
|_ Title.js
|_  Form.js
    |_MarsRover.js
      |_Curiosity.js
      |_OpportunityAndSpirit.js
    |_Timezone.js
      |_EarthDate.js
      |_MartianSol.js
    |_SubmitButton.js
|_  Pictures.js
```

I haven't spend any thought on design yet, as I want it to be fully functional beforehand, but I may put Form.js into a sidebar and show the pictures in a separated frame.
